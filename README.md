Prediction of Cryptocurrency Prices Using Machine Learning based on Blockchain Info

If you were to pick the three most ridiculous fads of 2017, they would definitely be fidget spinners , artificial intelligence and, yes, cryptocurrencies. I
m actually not a hodler of any cryptos. So, while I may not have a ticket to
the moon, I can at least get on board the hype train by successfully predicting
the price of cryptos by harnessing deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence (yes, all of them!). 

Prediction of mature financial markets such as the stock market has been
researched at length. Bitcoin presents an interesting parallel to this being a leading cryptocurrency in
the world with adoption growing consistently over time. The open, decentralised nature of Bitcoin, peer-to-peer and trust-
less system in which all transactions are posted to an open ledger called the
Blockchain. Deep learning makes for an interesting
technological solution based on its performance in similar areas. The recurrent neural
network (RNN) and the long short term memory (LSTM), ARIMA and twitter sentiment analysis are best approaches.
As there exists relationship between Bitcoin and search informations such as Google Trends and wavelet analysis of Bitcoin, sentiments of online cryptocommunities, tweets, macro financial indices, we here will be bridging the gap between these two by Machine Learning.
