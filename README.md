Prediction of Cryptocurrency Prices Using Machine Learning based on Blockchain Info

If you were to pick the three most ridiculous fads of 2017, they would definitely be fidget spinners , artificial intelligence and, yes, cryptocurrencies. I
m actually not a hodler of any cryptos. So, while I may not have a ticket to
the moon, I can at least get on board the hype train by successfully predicting
the price of cryptos by harnessing deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence (yes, all of them!). 

Prediction of mature financial markets such as the stock market has been
researched at length. Bitcoin presents an interesting parallel to this as it is
a time series prediction problem with high volatility. In addition, Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency in
the world with adoption growing consistently over time. The open
nature of Bitcoin, decentralised, peer-to-peer and trust-
less system in which all transactions are posted to an open ledger called the
Blockchain. Deep learning makes for an interesting
technological solution based on its performance in similar areas. The recurrent neural
network (RNN) and the long short term memory (LSTM) are best.
Various studies on statistical or economical properties and characteriza-
tions of Bitcoin prices refer to its capabilities as a financial asset, the re-
lationship between Bitcoin and search information, such as Google Trends
and Wikipedia, and wavelet analysis of Bitcoin and BGT-Blockchain Google
trends.We here will be bridging the gap between these two by Machine Learn-
ing.
